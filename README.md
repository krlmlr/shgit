shgit
-----

Unintrusive, lightweight git shell. Design/implementation considerations:

- No external dependencies other than git and bash
- 256 Colors (c'mon, it's 2018)
- Configurable through git
- Modular, and extendable
- By default, invoke as little git operations as possible
  (for stupid enterprise environments/slow homes/low resources)
- Works with vanilla bash
- Doesn't clobber your personal aliases/setups (or at least tries to)

Installation:
-------------
1. git clone git@github.com:roeme/shgit.git
2. cd shgit && ./install.sh install


Customization:
--------------
shgit is configured through git, and uses the section `[shgit]` if there's no
fitting standard section. The following options are available in `[shgit]`:

* `quiet_init` (Boolean, Default false):

    Don't print initialization messages.

* `suppress_keyword_alert` (Boolean, Default false):

    If your aliases include a shell keyword, shgit will warn upon this and won't
    make the alias available at top-level. This setting will suppress the message.

* `pwd-max-len` (Int, Default 20):

    Maximum length of working directory to display in prompt (longer will be
    truncated).

* `trunc-symbol` (String, Default "‚Ä¶"):

    Truncation character to be used for working directory display.

* `prompt-command-mode` (Enum, Default "override"):

    Tells `shgit` how to modify the prompt.

    * `override`:
        Use shgit's standard prompt.

    * `stealthy`:
        Simply prepend ps1-prefix to `$PS1` to indicate shgit. If `PROMPT_COMMAND`
        is set, it will be modified by shgit to make sure `$PS1` is adjusted.

    * `no-touchy`:
        Instructs to shgit to not touch `$PROMPT_COMMAND` at all and leave your
    original setting intact. Make sure you don't get confused when using this,
    as depending on your settings there might be no visual indication that the
    shell environment has been modified (You'll probably want `stealthy`
    instead).

    * `custom`:
        Run a completely custom `$PROMPT_COMMAND`, set in `custom-prompt-command`.
    If you want to implement your own custom prompt, have a look at the internal
    function `shgit_prompt_cmd` to cherry-pick whatever you need.

    The settings `stealthy` and `no-touchy` will stop shgit from executing _any_
    git commands whatsoever when prompting the user, rendering the shell even
    faster. When using `custom`, that is up to you, naturally.

* `ps1-prefix` (String, Default "üêö "):

    Custom prefix that gets prepended to "$PS1" when `prompt-command-mode` is
    set to `stealthy`.

* `custom-prompt-command` (String, Default unset):

    Custom `$PROMPT_COMMAND`. Only read if `prompt-command-mode` has been set to
    `custom`, ignored otherwise.

* `hook-cd` (Boolean, Default false)

    Tells shgit to hook cd, so instead of cwd to $HOME by default, this will
    move to the current repo's root.


## Colors
Colors can be configured through git, by using the standard `[color]` section.
shgit uses the `shgit` prefix for configurable items. Have a look into the code
for a current list of things that can be colorized.
