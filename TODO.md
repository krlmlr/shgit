Consider this a scratchpad for now. Subject to change.

* make it possible to limit command completion to git commands only
* add repo state indicators (dirty/diffs/etc)
* make it easier to switch repos (and hence, reload per-repo settings)
* use isolated history file

done (reference only)
---------------------
* make it possible to have silent initialization (configurable)
* make it possible to have the user define shell keywords (but only as far as it makes sense.)
* Set up git aliases like shell aliases
